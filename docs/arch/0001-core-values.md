# ADN 0001 - SorWeTo - Core values

While writing a framework - like Mojo or Sorweto, there are multiple points
where you have to choose between imposing an opinion, choosing something
for the users of the framework and being able to provide useful functionality,
or limiting the functionality that you push into the framework.

While starting Sorweto, that choice is ever present, but the main driver
behind Sorweto is functionality, specifically, the type of functionality
that is used over and over in small social websites. And because of that
Sorweto will impose choices, because it is impossible to provide functionality
without making choices.

But, Sorweto is intended as a framework to help speed up very different types
of websites, and for that reason, the majority of the functionality provided
by Sorweto is going to to packaged in the form of plugins that can be
activated as needed.

As much as needed, the interfaces of the more core plugins will be kept minimal
so that anyone wanting to make different choices will be able to rewrite those
plugins and still use the majority of the remaining plugins.

Sorweto is also (been) written in a way that extending it is very each to
achieve - as that is its main objective - it is not intended as a standalone
system, but as one that can easily be extended and used to make your own
websites and web applications.
