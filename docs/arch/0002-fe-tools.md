# ADN 0002 - SorWeTo - Default template using bootstrap 4

While starting to write some code that needs frontend bits and pieces
I started wondering how much to have the base templates being just
raw and leave it to the end apps to define the whole frontend pieces
using whatever framework system they would like.

However that would make it very hard to make some of the things I want
to do, and having a simple way to start a website with as little
templating/design as possible, so I decided to implement the base template
using only bootstrap 4.

Later we can start a few basic themes using other frameworks, and those can
in the future be used as the base for any other themes.
